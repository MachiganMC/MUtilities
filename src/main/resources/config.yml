#
#Welcome to the file configuration of the plugin MUtilities.
#Here is a guide to teach you how to configure the plugin :
#This is a copy of the "config_en.yml" file. If you want, a empty configuration file is available in the file "empty_config.yml"
#Si vous êtes francophone, une configuration et un guide en français sont disponibles dans le fichier "config_fr.yml"
#
#
#First, the plugin allow you to use the Minecraft color code. For example, if you want to put the test
#in red, you have to use "&4" before the text (all allowed color code are here : https://minecraft.tools/fr/color-code.php)
#
#
#The plugin use "intern variable" allowing you to personnalise your messages. Each variable name is between "{" and "}"
#(e.g.: "{player}"). Values depending on the situation and all can't be used everywhere, but here is the mainly used :
#  {prefix} : return the prefix of the module
#  {sender} : return the sender name of the command
#  {perm} : return the name of the permission that the player doesn't have to use a command
#
#Every intern variable allowed to be written is specified in each field (sometimes parent, so the children field of this field can use it)
#Example :
#
#  create:
#    only player: "{prefix} &bThis command can only be executed by a player"
#    #{survey}
#    already survey: "{prefix} &bThere is already a survey"
#    miss argument: "{prefix} &bPlease, specify the survey"
#    #{survey}
#    success: "{prefix} &bA survey was created :\n&r{survey}"
#    #{survey}, {creator}
#    announcement: "{prefix} &bA new survey is just created by &3{creator}\n&5/survey
#           vote [yes|no|useless]"
#
#Here, every child field of "create" field can use "{prefix}". The field "already survey" can use {survey}, but not the field
#"only player".
#
#
#The configuration of the modules "task", "salary," "notification" and "reaction" ask you (in the "build" field) to create your own
#field (who have children field predefined).
#You can name it like you want (in respect with .yaml file syntax, of course), in the list of tasks/salaries/notifs/reacts you will have to
#rewrite exactly the name of the parent field (children of "build" field).
#Example :
#
#  list:
#    - my task
#  build:
#    my task:
#      action: "BREAK"
#      object : "STONE"
#      quant: 10
#      time: 2 #in minute
#      command: "minecraft:give {player} stone 64"
#      message: "{prefix} &bAchieve this task for a reward : &e&obreak 10 cobblestone"
#
#Here the name of the field (that you have to create) "my task" is rewritten in the list field "list", this field (the field that you have created)
#has children field predefined and obligatory : "action", "object", "quant", "time", "command" and "message".
