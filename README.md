## Welcome :

Welcome to the official GitHub of the plugin **MUtilities** !

Here you'll find a little presentation of the plugin,
the source code of the plugin, the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/MachiganMC/MUtilities/wiki)
of the plugin and some
additional files.

## Presentation :
***
**MUtilities** is a plugin composed of several "*modules*". Each module is a little
plugin independent of other modules. So if you don't want to use some module, juste 
disable them and the plugin in the configuration file.

Currently, the plugin is composed of **8** modules :
* **Auction** : allow player to create an auction to sell their item.
* **Colorname** : allow player to "*pimp*" their username with color and form
* **Notif** :  send information to the online player to remind them some basics things 
* **Prout** : allow player to make talk other player with predefined (*by you*) messages
* **React** : make some reaction games in the tchat 
* **Survey** : allow player to create surveys to ask questions to the players
* **Task** : each *x* minute, yours players will have to do a task to win an award


You can find the completest presentation of each module (*with the commands, 
permissions etc...*) in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/MachiganMC/MUtilities/wiki) of the GitHub.

## Dependencies :
***
* The plugin offers PlaceHolders for
[PlaceHolderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)
  (*go to PlaceHolders section for more information*). So he requires the plugin, if you
want to use the PlaceHolders of the plugin.
* If you want to use the **auction module**, you'll have to have also 
[Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) (*to bid to an auction
players have to pay*). And also
[EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)
to provide the economy. If the plugin doesn't detect 
[Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) or
[EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/). The auction module
(if he's enabled) will automatically be disabled. 

*N.B. : If you want other economy types in the plugin, don't hesitate to suggest.
I'll do my best to add it to the plugin*
